After discussion with Paul and Darren we decided on an implementation plan, documented here.
(1) Dump preferred names and synonyms (TEXT), term ids, and ontology virtual ids from BioPortal triple store to a file
(2) Walk files and process TEXT according to algorithm described in previous followup
(3) Sort file on all columns and uniq file
(4) Walk through the file creating an entry in a mappings file (NEWMAPPINGS) for rows with the same value of TEXT.
(a) do not create mapping of a term in an ontology to any term in the same ontology
(b) do not create mappings between terms in ontologies if neither ontology has changed since the last processing (can be conservative here and create additional mappings which will be filtered later)
(5) dump all loom mappings from mappings db to file (OLDMAPPINGS) and sort
(6) remove all entries in NEWMAPPINGS which are present in OLDMAPPINGS (suggest &quot;join -v&quot;)
(7) upload NEWMAPPINGS file to mappings db

One additional item pointed out by Natasha. We do not want mapping from synonyms to synonyms. Mapping from preferred names to synonyms are fine. The synonym-to-synonym mappings generated in previous trials contained too much garbage. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
